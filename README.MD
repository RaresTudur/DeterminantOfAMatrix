# Matrix Determinant Calculator
This project is a simple Python script that calculates the determinant of a matrix using two different methods: the Leibniz method and the Gauss–Jordan elimination.
## Usage
To use this script, simply run the `determinant.py` file in your terminal, passing the matrix as a command line argument. The array must be entered in major row order, with rows separated by semicolons and values separated by spaces. For example, to calculate the determinant of the matrix:

```math
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9 \\
\end{matrix}
```
you should execute the following command:

```python
python3 determinant.py
Please enter the size of the matrix:
3
Please enter the matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Choose the method of calculating the determinant:
1. Gauss–Jordan Elimination Method
2. Leibniz method
3. Both methods
```
